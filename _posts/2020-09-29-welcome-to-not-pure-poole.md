Within the framework this project, we tried to understand whether the company should implement a new page or keep the old page with the statistical techniques.
![testing](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/images/blog-images/12-Lessons-from-Running-512-AB-Tests-in-One-Year_Invesp-1.png)

we used this following:
- Probability based approach.
- A/B test.
- Regression approach.

# Probability based approach:

- We will try to find probability of an individual receiving the new page or an old page and what are the chances of those.

# A/B test:

- In A/B test we set up our hypothesis to test if new page results in better conversion or not.
- We will simulate our user groups with respect to conversions.
- We will find the the p_value.
- We will also use an alternative approach to validate / double check our results and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

# Regression Approach:

- We shall look at exploring two possible outcomes. Whether new page is better or not.
- By further adding geographic location of the users, we will attempt to find if any specific country had an impact on conversion
