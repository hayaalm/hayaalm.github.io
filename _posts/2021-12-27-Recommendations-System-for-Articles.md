For this project I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like.

My project is divided into the following tasks:

`I.` Exploratory Data Analysis

Find out the distribution of articles a user interacts within the dataset and provide a visual and descriptive statistics.


`II.` Rank Based Recommendations

Provide two functions to get n top articles names and n top articles ids.


`III.` User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
Function `create_user_item_matrix`: reformat the df dataframe to be shaped with users as the rows and articles as the columns. 
* Each user should only appear in each row once.
* Each article should only show up in one column. 
* If a user has interacted with an article, then place a 1 where the user-row meets for that article-column. It does not matter how many times a user has interacted with the article, all entries where a user has interacted with an article should be a 1. 
* If a user has not interacted with an item, then place a zero where the user-row meets for that article-column


`V.` Matrix Factorization
Build use matrix factorization to make article recommendations to the users on the IBM Watson Studio platform.
